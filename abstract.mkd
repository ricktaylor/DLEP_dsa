When using the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [](#I-D.ietf-manet-dlep) to bootstrap neighbour
discovery for routing protocols there is no indication in the core DLEP protocol
of the services of the router announced at a destination. This forces an
implementation to either rely on a priori configuration or use heuristic probing
of well-known ports to discover potential routing peers.

This document defines an extension to DLEP to enable a router to advertise its
active services to its peer modem, allowing a connected remote modem to announce
the services of a router in a DLEP destination message to its peer, removing
the need for service discovery between routing peers. The mechanism is
designed to be sufficiently generic to allow the advertisement of network
services beyond routing protocols, enabling the fast bootstrapping of other
protocols such as messaging protocols or header compression.
